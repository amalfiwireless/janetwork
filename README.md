# Jane Network
A decentralized network for women to seek safe gynaecological counsel anonymously
## Inspiration
The idea for this hack came from an introsem at Stanford called "Abortion in Fiction" that I am taking this quarter (Spring 2018). Even in the 21st century, maternal mortality rates in parts of Africa and Asia are far worse than those that existed in Europe in the 1700s. While we make medical breakthroughs every day, committing even small changes to the legal jargon and red tape that surround "taboo" topics such as abortion takes a long time to propagate from conception to being available to the masses. This problem is even more accentuated for women in developing countries in Africa and South Asia where the population, sanitation, religious practices and misinformation get in the way of acceptance. This leads to the loss of lives we can save if we have a better way of talking about these stigmatizing topics. 

Nevertheless, in the meantime, I would like to present **Jane Network**, a _decentralized_ community of doctors, medical practitioners, abortion providers and certified midwives in and around where you live who can provide safe gynecological help who you can reach out to absolutely _anonymously_!

## What it does
Jane Network, like its counterpart in Chicago of the 60s and 70s is a way through which women and couples who are trying to prevent a pregnancy, unplanned or otherwise, can seek help in their vicinity by contacting certified doctors, medical practitioners, abortion providers and midwives who conform to the highest level of modern medical practices in order to get safe and comfortable treatment before things get worse.

## How I built it
In order to achieve my goals, I deployed two smart contracts written in Solidity on a test network that I created using Truffle and Ganache. In the process, I learned some neat tricks that I can perform with the terminal on my Mac while gaining some super important insights into how decentralized apps work. I wrote the front end using of this decentralized app using a meteor container.

## Challenges I ran into
